# Spectral Rainbow Forest!

This mod adds a new biome where you can find (almost) all [Spectrum](https://github.com/DaFuqs/Spectrum) trees
The excluded trees are: White, Brown, Gray and Black

It's a simple project made for fun, but it's still a beta!
I haven't checked the frequency of the biome (I hope setting it to the lowest priority works)

Said that I label this project as completed, but if you have feedback I'll still listen, reply and maybe update the mod


## The first release! 

It has taken me a couple of days, but it's finally usable

Beware, the generation is wonky and it creates large biomes (which is half intended) but it kind of generates too close?
Please let me know if this is the case for you!

Here is the link to download the mod [link](https://github.com/JustCoderdev/SpectralRainbowForest/releases/)
I'm not planning on releasing it to modrinth or forge for the time being, I first want to gather feedback and try to enhance the biome generation step
